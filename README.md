Please Note this is a documentation of my Home assistant project, the purpose is not to provide code for others (sorry)
### 23 June 2024
-A few weeks ago close to the 17 June 2024 I decided to play with Home Assistant an open source software for home automation and various other things.
-I setup the HA on a virtual machine running on my daily driver 
- In order to access the server from anywhere in the world I followed a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDxmtRByXDY&t=426s) to set up Tailscale which is a VPN, the server is HTTPS so it is safe as with all devices connected to the virtual network
- I started using ESP32s to control, read sensors and have everything accessed by the cloud
- On the 22 June 2024 I was able to switch a LED on and off which will lead to the controlling of a relay to control a geyser in the house
- Today marked the day where I used [uBlox GPS](https://www.robotics.org.za/GY-NEO6MV2?search=GPS) module to get the longitude and latitude of the device
